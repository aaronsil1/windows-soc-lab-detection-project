# windows-soc-lab-detection-project
This repository contains a home SOC lab project designed to simulate real-world attacks on a Windows environment, collect and analyze telemetry via Sysmon, and create detection rules and dashboards in Splunk. The goal is to demonstrate hands-on defensive security skills including log analysis, alert creation, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK mapping.
