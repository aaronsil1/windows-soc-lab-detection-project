# Windows SOC Lab – Attack Simulation & Detection Project

## Objective
To simulate real-world attack techniques in a controlled lab environment and develop detection logic using Windows logs and Splunk SIEM.

---

## Lab Architecture

The lab environment consists of:

- Windows 10 Virtual Machine (Target + Log Source)
- Sysmon for enhanced logging
- Splunk SIEM for log ingestion and detection
- (Planned) Kali Linux VM for attack simulation

### Network Configuration
- Host-Only network for isolated lab communication
